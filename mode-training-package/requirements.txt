# Dependency conflict resolution:
# - google-api-python-client>=2.0.0 ensures compatibility with google-api-core 2.x (in pre-built container)
# - pyarrow constraint: ibis-framework (transitive dep of datasets) requires pyarrow<15
#   Pinning to <15 to satisfy ibis-framework, even though container has pyarrow 22.0.0
pyarrow>=14.0.0,<15.0.0
